# guessing_game_python
A guessing game is developed by me in vs code using random module to use random int function in the program. The program simply prompt the user to guess numbers from 1 to 10 and he type the number untill unless the guessed number becomes equal to the number generated by the program. If user guess the right number, then program says "YOU WIN" and then program ends.
